	[[insight]] and [[Humour]] both involve the restructuring of [[patterns]]
[[Creativity]] also involve the restructuring but with more emphasis on the escape from restricting [[patterns]]. [[Creativity]] focuses on result while [[Lateral thinking]] emphasizes process.
[[Humour]]
[[Ideas]]
[[vertical thinking]] move forward by sequential steps each of which must be justified (e.g. logic or math); select only relevant info. In [[Lateral thinking]] we can be wrong (or seek out irrelevant information) at one stage in order to achieve correct solutions. [[Lateral thinking]] is generative; [[vertical thinking]] is selective.
[[Lateral thinking]] involves restructuring, escape and provocation of new patterns; concerned with new idea generation; liberation from old ideas and stimulation of new ones.[^1]
