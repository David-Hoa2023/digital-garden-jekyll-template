> the call is a vital force involved in building mental emotional and physical resilience[^1]

> the cold is a potent activator of the [[sympathetic nervous system]] it causes [[vasoconstriction]] increases [[metabolism]] releases [[noradrenaline]] activates [[brown fat]] and influences the [[immune system]] and much more
> 
> knowing our boundaries and keeping these boundaries in check
> 
>  stepping out of our comfort zone but still within our limits
>  
>  the cold is a [[hormetic stressor]][^2]  which a small but effective stress that causes our body to [[adapt]]; it is beneficial due to [[stress responses]] and changes in [[Metabolism]]; it sets off [[protective mechanism]], [[cellular responses]] to [[stress]] that promotes adaptation to stressful environments.
>  our cars and homes' thermal comfort does not challenge us to adapt to changing temperatures.
>  
>  the modern environment has made us more comfortable but also weaker
>  
>  by preparing ourselves for the cold through the [[breath]] we influence our [[bodily  reactions]], we [[prime our body]] to cope better with this [[stressor]]. Consequently this leads to more stress resilience in the longer run as we are increasing our stress threshold.
>  
>  [[cross-adaptation]] of [[stress responses]]: adaptation to the cold exposure helps with other stressful situations in everyday life.
>  
>  cold exposure as a cardiovascular workout: for the system's proper functioning the 
blood needs to be pumped around through the vessels efficiently without the heart working too hard. Training these [[vascular muscles]] with them cold means that we make these [[vascular muscles]] more flexible and gain more control over them.

> With the cold we train the [[vascular muscle]]s to rapidly contract and relax. Consequently the cold offers a great way to train and improve the [[cardiovascular system]]
> 
> Cold exposure trains our [[thermal regulation]]. We sweat when we are getting too warm 
and we shiver when we're getting too cold. Our body temperature is kept in check by the [[hypothalamus]].

> when our [[body temperature]] rises, receptors in the skin and the [[hypothalamus]] senses the temperature change. This change triggers a command from the brain which causes air response.
> 
> the temperature in the less vital parts can rise and drop. When our [[body temperature]] drops the [[hypothalamus]] sends [[nerve impulses]] to the skin to stimulate [[shivering]].

> through the [[WHM]] we adapt even more to the cold. By practicing the [[breathing]] exercises we increase mechanically and metabolically energy through activating the [[intercostal muscles]] this generates heat that dissipates to the lung tissue and warms up the surrounding blood.
	> 
> this also stimulates [[brown fat]] adipose - the ability to transfer energy into heat quickly. this can counteract a decrease in [[body temperature]] that would otherwise occur from exposure to cold. Thus our [[body temperature]] will rise.
> 
>The initial shock and burst in clarity on the first contact with the cold are due to the huge  release of [[noradrenaline]] also known as [[norepinephrine]]. Cold exposure can increase [[adrenaline]] by 530 percent - 5.3 times more than your normal average energy control. 
>
>[[noradrenaline]] acts both as a [[hormone]] and a [[neurotransmitter]].
It is responsible for that burst of [[wakefulness]] because it releases and mobilizes the brain and body into action. This results in improved [[focus]], [[attention]], [[diligence]] and [[mood]].

> [[noradrenaline]] has such an influence on our brain that when it is depleted,[[Depressive symptoms]] can occur. It is therefore also no wonder that some [[pharmacological medications]] treating [[ADHD]] and [[depression]] target [[noradrenaline]] depletion. 
> 
> [[noradrenaline]] also acts as a powerful [[vasoconstrictor]] this means that blood
starts to move away from your limbs and into your core to ensure the most vital organs remain safe and warm. Thus [[noradrenaline]] has a powerful ability to constrict veins and arteries and reroute blood to the core. [[noradrenaline]] is also a [[stress hormone]]
therefore it is not beneficial to have constantly high levels of no adrenaline in the system.

> Short ice bath works as [[hormetic stressor]] and increase [[noradrenaline]] only for a short time frame.
> 
> [[dopamine]] another [[happy hormone]] is also increased by 250 percent by [[cold exposure]] at 14 degrees celsius. Knowing that [[dopamine]] and [[noradrenaline]] rise upon cold exposure we can assume that cold exposure causes a net positive effect on [[mental well-being]]

> [[cold exposure]] lowers [[inflammation]] and strengthens the [[immune system]] [[inflammation]]  helps us fight against harmful microorganisms in the body, remove dead cells and tissues that were damaged from this [[inflammatory process]] and repair tissue.

> [[acute inflammation]] is a beautiful tool to help the body healthy and in check prolonged [[inflammation]] however does the body harm. Research shows that [[chronic inflammation]] is highly associated with the risk of death loss of cognitive function and dependency. The hormones [[noradrenaline]] and [[cortisol]] released through cold exposure act as [[anti-inflammatory agents]] and thus [[cold exposure]] can help against [[chronic inflammation]]

>[[thermogenesis]]: the process of creating heat
>  at outside temperatures of 17-18 degrees celsius and below, thermosenses will be triggered and send signals to the brain this will set in motion specific behavioral patterns that increase heat and minimize heat loss, re-establishing the body's temperature homeostasis
##### the body has different options to contain and create heat:
>
>  1. [[vasoconstrictio]]n retains core body heat
>   2. [[shivering]] [[thermogenesis]]: heat production through muscle [[shivering]] is well known as the first line of defense to acute [[cold exposure]] . [[shivering]] can increase [[metabolic heat production]] up to three- four times compared to non-shivering
>   3. mechanical exercise: by working out and exercising we convert energy into motion and heat.  breathing exercises activate the intercostal muscles, resulting in generating heat that warms up the body. Through the horse stance we generate heat by activating the muscles in the legs.
>   4. non-shivering thermogenesis:by increasing the metabolism by the activity of brown adipose tissue.  [[brown fat]] is a fat tissue that type that can release energy in the form of heat. this heat release is activated by cold exposure starting at temperatures around 16 degrees celsius.
##### Duration of [[cold exposure]]: 
1-2 minutes (the recommended time for someone who is taking an ice bath for the first time). The initial shock of an [[ice bath]] puts the body in a [[sympathetic state]]. This influences the breathing of participants which can turn fast and shallow. The first 30 till 60 seconds are usually the hardest then the body slowly adapts and relaxes.  Focus on taking long out breaths can accelerate this process.

##### temperature
 the colder the temperature the shorter the cold training should be. Water strips away heat much more quickly than air. Reflecting on this, the water's thermal neutral condition is 35 degrees celsius while for air this is 26 degrees celsius.
 
 ##### risks safety measures and contraindications
  Consciously and gradually practicing [[cold exposure]]: starting slowly and gradually build up [[cold exposure]]; train without forcing anything and listen to [[body signal]]s.  Staying in control and [[knowing our boundaries]]. We must give our bodies a margin of safety.  The [[horse stance]] helps to [[warm up]] from the inside to avoid a possible [[after-drop]] after [[cold exposure]].  Someone who appears completely fine getting out of the water may be in trouble 10 minutes later.
