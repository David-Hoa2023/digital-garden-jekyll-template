[[autopilot mode]]

### The Benefits of Automaticity: 
-Function quickly and efficiently without [[paying attention]] to every tiny detail; freeing up [[attentional resources]]; 

-Feel comfortable and familiar with different environments. Through our experiences, we learn what is common and expected in different situations. "When we walk into a grocery store, we know automatically how things are supposed to go,"

-Thanks to [learning](https://www.verywellmind.com/learning-study-guide-2795698), practice, and repetition, these repeated behaviors have become automatic.

### The Risks:
-As the action becomes so routine and habitual, we might neglect to really check traffic before stepping out into the road.
-One way to fight automaticity is to introduce novelty and to vary routines. Employers might design organizational routines that vary tasks or even rotate workers between different tasks; Shifting attention between tasks breaks up the repetition and helps draw workers out of autopilot mode. E.g. Check-list: by engaging multiple senses in the checklist process.
