#### DEFINITION
getting the other to admit an impossibility or contradiction.


#### APPLICATION
The [[Zeno]]'s argument proceeded like this: If statement P is true then statement Q^is true. In addition, it can be shown that if statement P is true then statement Q_is not true. Inasmuch as it is impossible that statement Q^is both true and not true at the same time ([[law of noncontradiction]]), it is therefore impossible that statement P is true.
[[Argument by refutation]] can prove only negative results (i.e., P is impossible). To prove an affirmative, we adopt as a premise the opposite of what we want to proveâ€”namely, the [[contradictory]] of our conclusion. This way, once we have refuted the premise by an [[absurdity]], we have proven that the [[opposite]] of
what we wanted to prove is impossible. Today this is called an indirect proof or a [[proof by contradiction]].

Euclid, assuming that there was a finite number, arrived at a [[contradiction]]. Therefore, his initial premise that there was a finite number of primes must be
false. If it is false that "there is a finite number of primes" then it is true that "there is not a finite number." In other words, there is an infinite number.
