#### DEFINITION
Terms called quantifiers are available for making [[propositions]]. The English words all and every are called (affirmative) [[universal quantifiesr]] in [[logic]]. They indicate the totality (100 percent) of something. Sometimes the all is implied, as in "Members in good standing may vote." The word any is sometimes regarded as a universal quantifier. The article a may also be used as a universal quantifier.

In [[logic]] books, the [[universal affirmation]] is often introduced to the reader as "All S are P." (S=subject and P= predicate.)

Other [[universal affirmation]]: "Socrates was a Greek." "I am a teacher." These [[propositions]] do not, on the surface, appear to be [[universal propositions]]. They are called singular or individual and are treated as [[universal claims]]. 9"All
things that are identical with Socrates were Greek" or "All things that belong to the class of things that are me are teachers.")[^1]
