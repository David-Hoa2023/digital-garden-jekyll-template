#### DEFINITION

accepted truths, called [[premises]] [^1].

#### APLICATION
We begin with true (or agreed upon) statements, called [[premises]], and concede at each step that the next statement or construction follows legitimately from the previous statements. When we arrive at the final statement, called our conclusion, we know it must necessarily be true due to our logical chain of [[reasoning]][^2].

Socrates accepts his opponent's premise as true, and by logical deduction, forces his opponent to accept a contradictory or absurd conclusion.

This technique of refuting a hypothesis by baring its inconsistencies takes the following form: If statement P is true, then statement Q^is true. But statement Q^ cannot be true. (Q^is absurd!) Therefore, statement P cannot be true. This form of argument by refutation is called [[reductio ad absurdum]].[^3].
