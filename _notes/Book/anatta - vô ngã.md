[[Đạo Phật -Buddhism]]
[[Ajahn Chah]]

> The belief in an immutable entity is the background to the idea of self, the idea that the self has a fixed, independent existence. The self exists—everybody has a self-identity—but the self is an endless series of changing phenomena that whorls about continuously, forever changing appearance, like a chameleon. It’s not that self doesn’t exist, but that it’s a bundle of dynamic change. So we cannot pin the self down and say it is this or it is that, because as soon as we pin it down,  it immediately becomes different.
