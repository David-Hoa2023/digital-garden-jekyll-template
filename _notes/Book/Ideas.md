[[Lateral thinking]]

Culture is concerned with establishing [[ideas]]
Education  is concerned with communicating these established ideas. Assumption: only 	need to collect more and more information. How about the best way of using info collected?
Both are concerned with improving ideas by bringing them up to date
Changing ideas is to create conflict between
1. Opposing ideas: one dominates, the other is suppressed but not changed
2.  Conflict between new information and old ideas which are supposed to be changed e.g. science bring new info to upset old ideas.

Conflict method only works when info can be evaluated objectively.
[[Insight]] (rearrangement of available info) is the only effective way of changing ideas when info can not be evaluated objectively
