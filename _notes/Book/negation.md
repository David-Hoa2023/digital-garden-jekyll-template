#### DEFINITION
more often than we may realize the only way to understand what something is is to have a clear understanding of what it isn't.

Cognitive psychologists Peter C. Wason and Philip Johnson-Laird point out that negation is a fundamental concept in reasoning, a concept so basic to our everyday thinking that no known language is without its negative terms. Negation
ought to be an easy, perhaps the easiest, form of deduction.

In one of their studies, Wason and Johnson-Laird performed a series of experiments. When asked questions that involved affirmation and negation, their subjects were slower in evaluating the truth of a negation than the falsity of an affirmation and got it wrong more often-—a clear indication that negation is a more
difficult concept to grasp.

###### implicit negative: 
"absent" rather than "not present," "reject" rather than "not accept," and "fail" rather than "not pass," may be easier to deal with than their explicitly negative counterparts.

- "The number is 9," also negates "The number is 4." (compared to  "The number is NOT 4.")
- The difficulties involved with trying to visualize something that is not may well interfere with one's ability to reason with negatives. If I say that I did not come by car, what do you see in your mind's eye?
- Wason and Johnson-Laird suggest that in everyday language a denial often serves as a device to correct a preconceived notion. The statement "Class wasn't boring today" would probably not be made if the class were generally not boring. This kind of statement is usually made when the class is frequently
or almost always boring. The statement functions to correct the listener's previously held impression by pointing out an exception.

#### APPLICATION
How would we define an odd number other than by saying it is a number that is not divisible by 2? What is peace but the absence of war?

Making a negative statement is a two-step process. If I say, "I am not an ornithologist," two statements must be absorbed. First, we must grasp what it means to be an ornithologist, then what it means not to be one.

When No Means Yes —The "Negative Pregnant" and Double Negative.
(negative pregnant means "a negative implying or involving an affirmative.") .
If asked, "Did you steal the car on November 4?" the defendant replying with the negative pregnant "I did not steal it on November 4" leaves the possibility (maybe even the implication) wide open that he nonetheless stole the car on some day.
