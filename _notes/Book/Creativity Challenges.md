Create about 4-8 groups for the challenge 
1. Assign each group **one person**, **one thing**, and **one adjective **
2. Then tell the groups that they can use **any materials in the room to design an object revolving around these three entities**. 
3. Get two groups to stand up, as they will compete against each other to **see who can create the best object around the constraints above in 60 seconds**
