#### DEFINITION
[[Aristotle]]: A proposition is any statement that has the property of truth or falsity. A prayer, Aristotle says, is not a proposition. "Come here" and "Where are you?" are not propositions. "2 + 2 = 5" is a proposition (it is false). "Socrates was a man" is a proposition (it is true). Propositions can be true or false and nothing in between ([[law of the excluded middle]]), but not both true and false at the same time ([[law of noncontradiction]]).

"That tornado is destructive" would certainly be either true or false but not both. "All tornadoes are destructive" might be a false proposition if it is true that
some tornadoes are not destructive.[^1]
