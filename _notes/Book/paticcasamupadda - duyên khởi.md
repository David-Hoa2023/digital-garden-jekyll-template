[[Đạo Phật -Buddhism]]

Buddhadasa explains [paticcasamupadda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paticcasamupadda "Paticcasamupadda") as the "birth" of "I" and mine through sense-contact with objects, and the resulting [[vedanās - thọ]] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vedana "Vedana") ("feeling"), [[Taṇhā]] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ta%E1%B9%87h%C4%81 "Taṇhā") ("thirst," craving) and [[upadana - thủ]] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upadana "Upadana") (clinging). It is by relinquishing the notion of "I" and "mine" that selfish clinging is abandoned, and [Nirvana] [[nibbana - niết bàn]]    (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nirvana "Nirvana") or true [emptiness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunyata "Sunyata") will be reached.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhadasa#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBuddhadasa1985a-8) This can be done by "not allow[ing] the dependent arising to take place; to cut it off right at the moment of sense-contact."[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhadasa#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBuddhadasa1985a-8)
