# Creative Problem Solving with SCAMPER

![Creative Problem Solving with SCAMPER](https://litemind.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/scamper-banner.jpg "Creative Problem Solving with SCAMPER")

SCAMPER is a technique you can use to spark your creativity and help you overcome any challenge you may be facing. In essence, SCAMPER is a general-purpose checklist with idea-spurring questions — which is both easy to use and surprisingly powerful. It was created by Bob Eberle in the early 70s, and it definitely stood the test of time.

In this posting, I present a complete SCAMPER primer, along with two free creativity-boosting resources: a downloadable reference mind map and an online tool that generates random questions to get you out of a rut whenever you need.

## SCAMPER Primer

**SCAMPER is based on the notion that everything new is a modification of something that already exists.** Each letter in the acronym represents a different way you can play with the characteristics of what is challenging you to trigger new ideas:

-   **S** = [[Substitute]]
-   **C** = [[Combine]]
-   **A** = [[Adapt]]
-   **M** = [[Modify]]
-   **P** = [[Put to Other Uses]]
-   **E** = [[Eliminate (or Minify)]]
-   **R** = [[Rearrange (or Reverse)]]

To use the SCAMPER technique, first state the problem you’d like to solve or the idea you’d like to develop. It can be anything: a challenge in your personal life or business; or maybe a product, service or process you want to improve. After pinpointing the challenge, it’s then a matter of asking questions about it using the SCAMPER checklist to guide you.

Consider, for instance, the problem "How can I increase sales in my business?"

Following the SCAMPER recipe, here are a few questions you could ask:

-   **S (Substitute):** "What can I substitute in my selling process?"
-   **C (Combine):** "How can I combine selling with other activities?"
-   **A (Adapt):** "What can I adapt or copy from someone else’s selling process?"
-   **M (Magnify):** "What can I magnify or put more emphasis on when selling?"
-   **P (Put to Other Uses):** "How can I put my selling to other uses?"
-   **E (Eliminate):** "What can I eliminate or simplify in my selling process?"
-   **R (Rearrange):** "How can I change, reorder or reverse the way I sell?"

These questions force you to think differently about your problem and eventually come up with innovative solutions.

A classic example is MacDonald’s founder [Ray Kroc](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_kroc). In hindsight, it’s easy to identify many of the ideas he used through the SCAMPER lens: selling restaurants and real estate instead of simply hamburgers **[P = Put to other uses]**; having customers pay before they eat **[R=Rearrange]**; letting customers serve themselves, avoiding the use of waiters **[E=Eliminate]** — just to mention a few.

You will find below a comprehensive help guide to using SCAMPER. There are more than 60 questions that can be asked, along with almost 200 words and expressions you can create associations with.

## SCAMPER Resources

### 1. SCAMPER Random Question Tool

[![SCAMPER Random Question Tool](https://litemind.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/scamper-random-question-tool-mini.png "SCAMPER Random Question Tool")](https://litemind.com/scamper-tool/ "SCAMPER Random Question Tool")

There are many ways to use SCAMPER. For example, you can sequentially go through all the questions in the previous section as fast as you can; or you can stay on each question until you think you exhausted all possibilities.

However, when it comes to creativity, getting random — and unexpected — input can really help your mind find a solution for that ‘impossible’ problem. With that in mind, as a companion to this article, I created the [SCAMPER Random Question Tool](https://litemind.com/scamper-tool/ "SCAMPER Random Question Tool"): it shows you an unexpected question drawn from all the SCAMPER questions in the previous section. Think about a problem that has been nagging you then give the tool a try to see how many options you can generate.

I’ve put together all the SCAMPER questions from the previous sections in a mind map, formatted for a single printed page. Think of it as a handy one-page reference you can use whenever you are stuck or just need a kick start to get your creative juices flowing.
