[[Đạo Phật -Buddhism]]

[Buddhaghosa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhaghosa "Buddhaghosa") uses "kammatthana" to refer to each of his forty meditation objects listed in the third chapter of the _[Visuddhimagga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visuddhimagga "Visuddhimagga")_, which are partially derived from the [Pāli Canon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P%C4%81li_Canon "Pāli Canon"). In this sense "kammatthana" can be understood as "occupations" in the sense of "things to occupy the mind" or "workplaces" in the sense of "places to focus the mind on during the work of meditation". Throughout his translation of the _Visuddhimagga_, [Nanamoli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%91%C4%81%E1%B9%87amoli_Bhikkhu "Ñāṇamoli Bhikkhu") translates this term simply as "**meditation subject**".[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamma%E1%B9%AD%E1%B9%ADh%C4%81na#cite_note-2)
