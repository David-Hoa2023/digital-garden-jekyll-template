By default, a typical Engineer will think in systems. A psychologist will think in terms of incentives. A biologist will think in terms of evolution. By putting these disciplines together in our head, we can walk around a problem in a three-dimensional way. If we’re only looking at the problem one way, we’ve got a blind spot. And blind spots can kill you.

When a botanist looks at a forest they may focus on the ecosystem, an environmentalist sees the impact of climate change, a forestry engineer the state of the tree growth, a business person the value of the land. None are wrong, but neither are any of them able to describe the full scope of the forest

A [[mental models - mô hình tư duy]] is a kind of internal symbol or representation of external reality, hypothesized to play a major role in [cognition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognition "Cognition"), [reasoning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reasoning "Reasoning") and [decision-making](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision-making "Decision-making"). [Kenneth Craik](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenneth_Craik "Kenneth Craik") suggested in 1943 that the mind constructs "small-scale models" of reality that it uses to anticipate events.

> The image of the world around us, which we carry in our head, is just a model. Nobody in his head imagines all the world, government or country. He has only selected concepts, and relationships between them, and uses those to represent the real system (Forrester, 1971).[^1]

> mental models can be constructed from perception, imagination, or the comprehension of discourse (Johnson-Laird, 1983). Such mental models are similar to architects' models or to physicists' diagrams in that their structure is analogous to the structure of the situation that they represent[^2]
