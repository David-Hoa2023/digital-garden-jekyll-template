### # 4. Quote popular culture

Apple loves to pull puns using well-known quotes or sentences to highlight their product features.

### Set a scene
A copy we wrote for another one of our clients—this time a corporate business coach who specializes in helping busy executives stop working 60-hour weeks. 

Have a look.

_I remember when Alan, one of those clients, first walked into my office…_ 

_His crisp suit and confident walk told me he was a shining success in his industry. But the bags under his bloodshot eyes, the shaky hands from too much coffee, and the creases in his forehead from a constantly furrowed brow told a different story…_

_I saw a man who, despite his company bringing in $11 million in yearly revenue, was exhausted and feeling stuck on a 12+-hour-a-day hamster-wheel while his business bled $500,000 a year in losses._ 

_Fast forward 10 months later__—__Alan’s company turned a profit. And for the first time in years, he and his wife took their first vacation in years._

# 1. Harness the power of repetition ([[điệp âm - điệp ngữ]])

Apple likes to reuse a word in the same sentence to emphasize a feature they want people to remember.

_Pro cameras. Pro display. Pro performance._[^2]

iPhone 11 Pro is a phone for those who need pro everything or want to be seen as a pro.

_A big, beautiful workspace.  
For doing big, beautiful work._
