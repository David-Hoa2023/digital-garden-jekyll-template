#### DEFINITION
[[Aristotle]] defined statements that [[contradict]] one another, or statements that are in a sense "[[opposites]]" of one another. Statements such as "No individuals are altruistic" and "Some individual(s) is (are) altruistic" are said to be [[contradictories]].
As [[contradictories]], they cannot both be true and cannot both be false—one must be true and the other false.

[[Aristotle]] declared that every [[affirmative statement]] has its own [[opposite negative]] just as every [[negative statement]] has an [[affirmative opposite]].

It may be --> It cannot be.
It is contingent [uncertain]. --> It is not contingent.
It is impossible. --> It is not impossible.
It is necessary [inevitable]. --> It is not necessary.
It is true. --> It is not true.

[[Universal affirmations]] and [[particular denials]] are [[contradictory statements]].

[[Universal affirmations]]: "Every person has enough to eat" is universal in nature, that is, it is a statement about all persons.
 [[particular denials]] "Not every person has enough to eat" or "Some persons do not have enough to eat"
 
[[ universal denials]] and [[particular affirmations]] are [[contradictories]].
[[ universal denials]]: "No individuals are altruistic"
 [[particular affirmations]]: "Some individuals are altruistic"
 
 ###### confusion of [[contradictories]] with contraries:
Aristotle defined contraries as pairs of statements—one affirmative and the other negative—that are both universal (or both particular) in nature. For example, "All people are rich" and "No people are rich" are contraries. Both cannot be true yet it is possible that neither is true (that is, both are false)[^1].

Contraries may both be false but cannot both be true. [[Contradictories]] are such that one of them is true if and only if the other is false.[^2]
